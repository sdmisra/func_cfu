# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

Today I think I am on the ball with time management, but I do struggle with it in general. I find that setting timers on my phone or watch, even if they are simply 1 hour increments that mean nothing specifically other than "time is passing at this rate" helps a lot with paying attention to the pace of the day.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
I would tell that 5 year old that this is grown up stuff. Kidding...:

I would tell him that a function is like a little robot that you can train to do specific things, and whenever you "call" the function, you are inviting the robot to do its job. 
The robot knows its job, but you need to tell it where to do it.
The robots job can be all sorts of stuff, but you have to re-program it or build a new robot it if you want it to do a different set of tasks.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
I think of parameters as the seats or positions to fill in a function, with the information it requires to perform the same task upon different bits of data. The "required input slots".

I think of arguments as the information itself that you want to plug into the function, aka the data you want processed.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
I would love to explore what happens when we start using the return values of functions and plug them into other functions. What happens when we start nesting logic in that way, and what starts to go wrong / where issues start appearing.
